# Triangle-Pattern-Programs

This repository contains programs that print a triangle pattern using stars in various programming languages.
# Languages

- Bash (triangle.sh)
- Assembly (x86-64) (triangle.asm)
- Go (triangle.go)
- Lisp (triangle.lisp)
- R (triangle.R)
- FORTRAN (triangle.f90)
- Perl (triangle.pl)
- BASIC (triangle.bas)
- Objective-C (triangle.m)
- COBOL (triangle.cbl)
- APL (triangle.apl)
- Pascal (triangle.pas)
- B (triangle.b)

# Usage

- Choose the program for your desired programming language.
- Save the program with the correct file extension (e.g., .sh for Bash).
- Run the program using the appropriate command for your operating system and programming language.

# Examples

- Bash: ./triangle.sh (after giving execute permissions with chmod +x triangle.sh)
- Assembly (x86-64): Assemble and link the program using an assembler like NASM, then run the resulting executable.
- Go: go run triangle.go
- Lisp: Load the program into a Lisp interpreter or compiler, then evaluate the print-triangle function.
- R: Run the program using R's command-line interface or an IDE like RStudio.
